Questions 4 - 6 can be answered using data visualization. To lay the groundwork for answering these questions using the survey data set, plan out your plots and set your expectations for what the data might look like. Please:

- sketch (with paper and pencil) a plot that captures the distribution or relationship between the variables,
- label the axis and add axis tick marks with plausible values,
- depict a shape that reflects your expectation of the phenomena,
- write out the *aesthetic mappings* (the variables in use and which visual cues / aesthetic each one is mapped to) and
- write out the *geometry* utilized by your plot.
