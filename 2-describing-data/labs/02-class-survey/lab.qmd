*Note: Ensure that your submission to Gradescope is a pdf built from a qmd that has the pages assigned to the questions. The sketches from Part I should be included in your pdf using the approach from Lab 1.*

## Part I: Understanding the Context of the Data

The first part of each of our labs will be a worksheet where you'll think more about the context of the data, help formulate your questions, and set expectations for what the data will look like. Please record your answers on the worksheet below and upload it to Gradescope as Lab 2.1.

## Part II: Computing on the Data

The real survey data is accessible on [stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu](stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu) as `class_survey`! It belongs to the `stat20data` library.

Using this data, construct the plots that you proposed in Part I and calculate for the first three a measure of a typical observation (mean, median, or mode, as appropriate). Use these summaries to answer the original question in a sentence or two, noting, where appropriate, the shape of the distribution and what a "typical" observation is.

7. How much coding experience do students have?

8. What are students' perceptions of the chance that there is a new COVID variant that disrupts instruction in Fall 2022?

9. What is the relationship between students' optimism for cryptocurrency and their skepticism of the effect of technology on interpersonal relationships?


## Part III: Extensions

Six variables appear in the survey data frame that were derived from the original `Title` question: `Artist`, `Humanist`, `Natural_Scientist`, `Social_Scientist`, `Comp_Scientist` and `Entrepreneur`. The `Artist` variable is `TRUE` for those students who most identified as an artist and `FALSE` otherwise. The other five variables are defined similarly.

For the following questions, please answer with a plot and a sentence or two written response given the structure in the plot.

10. Is there an association between students most identifying as an entrepreneur and their optimism for cryptocurrency?

11. Propose your own question involving one or two variables and answer it using a plot with a written interpretation.
